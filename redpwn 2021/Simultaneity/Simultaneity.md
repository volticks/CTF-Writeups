# Intro
This years redpwn started on the 9th of july, and ran through from 8PM BST till 8PM on the 12th. This was really fun, and I really praise the organisers for creating the superb
infrastructure and challenges that allowed me (and my [team-mates](https://ctftime.org/team/157675) or [here](https://ctftime.org/team/120331)) to toil away on these challenges. Cheers guys :).

This will be the first of (probably) a series of writeups for challenges in the pwn category of redpwnCTF 2021, disregarding the challenges I didn't solve.

## Description

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73792438/125520811-639fe7e9-d1bd-4897-93f3-a7670b54f4f8.png)

This challenge specifically was extremely difficult (for me). The vulnerability as you will see is very obvious. However exploitation is another matter that 
requires knowledge of some heap internals, and alot of guesswork on my part. With that out of the way, lets begin.

(The solution script is at the bottom as well as in the github folder, I forgot that in my last writeup.)

# Setup

So whats up?

Well first things first, were provided with a libc and a linker. If we want to correctly emulate the challenge environment, we need to patch these into the program. You can
do that like so:

```sh
patchelf ./simultaneity --set-interpreter ./ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --replace-needed libc.so.6 ./libc.so.6 --output simultaneity1
```
Now you should have `simultaneity1` which has the correct libc + linker. Something else to note is that the libc is stripped. There are quite a few ways to 'unstrip' a libc but 
I chose to download the debug symbols and simply use them with my gdb. To do this you can download the debug symbols that match the libc (you can get version info from a libc 
by running it), then extract them in the current
directory:

```sh
wget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/g/glibc/libc6-dbg_2.28-10_amd64.deb
mkdir dbg; dpkg -x libc6-dbg_2.28-10_amd64.deb ./dbg/
```
Now whenever you want to use these symbols in gdb, simply type: `set debug-file-directory dbg/usr/lib/debug/` and you should (fingers crossed) have working symbols.
Now we should be all set to take a look at the binary.

# The program

Its pretty simple:

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73792438/125348293-f066ed00-e353-11eb-835e-65cd30359f54.PNG)

The program asks `how big?` and we can provide a size, it then spits out what looks like a `main_arena` heap address (from a heap that is aligned with the data segment). It then
asks `how far?` and `what?`. It seems that the program is straight up giving us a thinly veiled write-what-where primitive, nice.

If we look at the decompiled code for `main()` we can confirm this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73792438/125348373-0aa0cb00-e354-11eb-89cc-5d2b3830c34f.png)

(ignore my mutterings at the bottom lol)
The program takes a `size` which is then passed to `malloc(size)` so we can control the size of an allocation. Then the program leaks the address of said allocation back to 
us. We can then specify another `size`/index that will then be multiplied by 8, then it will be added to the address of our allocation `(long)alloc + size * 8)`. We then use 
the result of this addition and write into it an `unsigned int`/`size_t`. 

Another cool thing about this (other than being given an extremely powerful exploit primitive) is that because the `how far?` part of the program takes a regular integer 
via `__isoc99_scanf("%ld", &size)` we can have a negative `size`/index. This, in turn means that we can not only write anywhere after our allocation, but also before.

# Approaches

Now i'll talk about the approach I tried initially. My first thought was, could we overwrite some interesting stuff on the heap? Maybe one of functions left something there?
However further inspection on the heap revealed that its just a barren wasteland. 

```
pwndbg> heap
Allocated chunk | PREV_INUSE
Addr: 0x55555555a000
Size: 0x251 <------------------+
                               |
Allocated chunk | PREV_INUSE   +------------ Metadata :yawn:
Addr: 0x55555555a250
Size: 0x411 <------------------ scanf()'s allocation to store our input in full
                              
Allocated chunk | PREV_INUSE   +------------ Our allocation
Addr: 0x55555555a660           |
Size: 0x21 <-------------------+

Top chunk | PREV_INUSE
Addr: 0x55555555a680
Size: 0x20981

```

Nothing interesting here, and nothing that could be easily exploited; i thought perhaps through some manipulation of the `top` we could allocate a chunk, perhaps with `scanf` 
(yes, `scanf` does this) somewhere it isn't meant to be? As it turns out, `scanf` will allocate the temporary buffer before it recieves our input+writes it, so sadly there is
no meddling we can do here, as no further allocations are made/free'd. Although under certain circumstances `scanf()` will `free()` the temporary buffer, so perhaps some 
opportunity exists there? I didn't think about this too much, though.

I was quickly drawn to another idea. Whats in the `.bss` atm?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73792438/125352528-4b4f1300-e359-11eb-9d8d-581a4a75cda4.png)

Not much, as you can see (and definitely nothing useful). My idea here was to overwrite some stuff and see what happened, did changing any of this stuff have any impact?
Sadly no. I was quite confident that modifying the `stdout@GLIBC` would have some effect, as the `FILE` struct is pretty complicated. But it was to no avail.

So we have a seemingly hopeless situation where we have very little, if any opportunity to overwrite anything; we have a (basically useless) `.text`/heap leak and no (reliable)
way to overwrite anything meaningful.

It was at this point where I became stuck for quite a while, and moved on to `image-identifier`. Only after finishing that and coming back did I realise what I had missed, on
the last day of the CTF.

# Gaining a (rather strong) foothold

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73792438/125354078-468b5e80-e35b-11eb-9eba-c21095da46e7.png)

I highlighted the important part. I neglected to fully consider the ability we have when controlling the size of an allocation. If we wanted, we could make `malloc()` fail and 
return a null pointer, but more importantly if an allocation is larger than the `top` chunk (aka, does not fit in the current heap) `malloc()` will use `mmap()` to allocate
some memory that fits the size of said allocation (if it can provide enough memory, that is). 

If we, for example allocate a chunk that is 1 larger that `top` (0x209a1+1) then we should be able to force `malloc()` to make our heap elsewhere. And sure enough:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73792438/125355878-6cb1fe00-e35d-11eb-8713-56e09c21ca91.png)

Yep, the entire allocation has moved elsewhere. But where exactly?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73792438/125355554-1644bf80-e35d-11eb-815f-2b095fd3f45e.png)

Our allocation is between the main heap and libc (`0x7ffff7deb000-0x7ffff7e0c000`). The most important aspect of this is that there is no flux/influence of ASLR between our heap
and all of libc. This means:

 - Since our heap is at a constant offset from libc, so is our leaked allocation address. We now have an easy way to get the base, and therefore the rest of libc.
 - As stated in the above, our allocation is at a constant offset from libc, this means that we may use our primitive to write INTO libc, anywhere we want.

Now that we have easy access to libc, we need a place to write. I tried a couple things here; none of which worked, however overwriting `__free_hook` did.

`__free_hook` is a global function pointer in libc that when NULL does nothing however when populated with any values, upon `free()` it will detect that the pointer is not 
NULL and instead jump to it. This makes it ideal, as `free()`, and therefore `__free_hook` are used alot more than you would expect, and so there are alot of opportunities for 
RCE with this value. Hooks like this also exist for `malloc()` and `realloc()` functions, making it an extremely easy way to execute a one-gadget in a pinch.

We can work out the difference of `__free_hook` from our allocation, then divide that by 8, ensuring that when it eventually gets multiplied by 8 in our 
`scanf("%zu",(void *)((long)alloc + size * 8)))` we still come out with the same value:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73792438/125357942-3629b280-e360-11eb-88c3-1abc4c729304.png)

We can then do a test run in gdb to make sure we are in fact writing to the correct location

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73792438/125358108-68d3ab00-e360-11eb-88bb-badc3cfdbbcb.png)

And sure enough, yes.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73792438/125358179-7f7a0200-e360-11eb-865f-bcc35d4836cc.png)

We can see that we do write to `__free_hook`. However on entering a random value you'll notice that we do not SEGFAULT before the `_exit()`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73792438/125358554-f44d3c00-e360-11eb-91f0-1ebd8d089d9f.png)

This can mean only one thing; our input is never allocated / is never `free`'d

# Some scanf stuff

Since `scanf` takes no `length` field, for all user input, even the stuff it doesnt care about (wrong format, wrong type, etc...) it has to take + store somehow. To do this
it uses a 'scratch'-buffer. This is a buffer that will store ALL the input from `scanf`. This starts as a stack buffer, however will fallback to being a heap buffer if this 
stack buffer threatens to overflow:

```c
/* Scratch buffers with a default stack allocation and fallback to
   heap allocation. [---snipped---]
```
[here](https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.28.9000/source/include/scratch_buffer.h#L22)

This heap buffer is re-used whenever another call to `scanf` comes via rewinding the buffer position back to the start, such that the space can be re-used:

```c
/* Reinitializes BUFFER->current and BUFFER->end to cover the entire
   scratch buffer.  */
static inline void
char_buffer_rewind (struct char_buffer *buffer)
{
  buffer->current = char_buffer_start (buffer);
  buffer->end = buffer->current + buffer->scratch.length / sizeof (CHAR_T);
}
```
[here](https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.28.9000/source/stdio-common/vfscanf.c#L216) and [here](https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.28.9000/source/stdio-common/vfscanf.c#L483)

Whenever we want to add to this buffer, we need to call `char_buffer_add`. This does a couple things. 1st it checks if we currently positioned at the end of our buffer, and 
if so it will take a 'slow' path. Otherwise it just adds a single character to the scratch buffer and moves on:

```c
static inline void
char_buffer_add (struct char_buffer *buffer, CHAR_T ch)
{
  if (__glibc_unlikely (buffer->current == buffer->end))
    char_buffer_add_slow (buffer, ch);
  else
    *buffer->current++ = ch;
}
```
[here](https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.28.9000/source/stdio-common/vfscanf.c#L256)

As you would expect, the slow path is for when we run out of space in our stack buffer, (or our heap buffer) and will move our input in its entirety to the heap when the 
conditions are right

```c
/* Slow path for char_buffer_add.  */
static void
char_buffer_add_slow (struct char_buffer *buffer, CHAR_T ch)
{
  if (char_buffer_error (buffer))
    return;
  size_t offset = buffer->end - (CHAR_T *) buffer->scratch.data;
  if (!scratch_buffer_grow_preserve (&buffer->scratch)) // <--------- important part is here
    {
      buffer->current = NULL;
      buffer->end = NULL;
      return;
    }
  char_buffer_rewind (buffer);
  buffer->current += offset;
  *buffer->current++ = ch;
}
```

If we delve a bit deeper we can actually find where exactly this allocation happens:

```c
bool
__libc_scratch_buffer_grow_preserve (struct scratch_buffer *buffer)
{
  size_t new_length = 2 * buffer->length;
  void *new_ptr;

  if (buffer->data == buffer->__space.__c) // If we are currently using the __space.__c buffer (stack buffer). This is the default for all inputs, initially.
    {
      /* Move buffer to the heap.  No overflow is possible because
	 buffer->length describes a small buffer on the stack.  */
      new_ptr = malloc (new_length);
      if (new_ptr == NULL)
	      return false;
      memcpy (new_ptr, buffer->__space.__c, buffer->length); // heres the 'move'
// [---snipped---]
      /* Install new heap-based buffer.  */
  buffer->data = new_ptr;
  buffer->length = new_length;
  return true;
```

`buffer->data` is where we write into the scratch buffer - at least the origin, anyway. 

From this we can understand that if we provide enough input - enough that we can progress the `buffer->current` to the `buffer->end` of the current buffer , we can 
trigger a new allocation with `malloc()`. This has some caveats though; if `scanf` expects a number (like with our `__isoc99_scanf("%zu...`) it will only progress the 
`buffer->current` if it recieves a digit. You can read the source here [here](https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.28.9000/source/stdio-common/vfscanf.c#L1396).

One thing I want to draw your attention to though, is this:

```c
	while (1)
	{
// [---snipped---]
	  if (ISDIGIT (c))
		{
		  char_buffer_add (&charbuf, c);
		  got_digit = 1;
		}
// [---snipped---]
```

What we have here, is what I assume to be the loop that goes through the values of each number, after the format string has been interpreted (but you can never be sure with libc 
code). As you can see, if our character is a digit, we add it to the buffer. Cool.

Now armed with this (somewhat useless) knowledge, we can go back and try writing to `__free_hook` again, but this time with at least 1024 bytes of digits in our buffer
in order to allocate a chunk that will be free'd on exiting `scanf()`. And sure enough if we spam enough, we can call `free` on our allocation and thus trigger 
`__free_hook`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73792438/125519774-a9246a30-4760-4c5f-8cfa-7482964f23be.png)

Now when we test in gdb:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73792438/125519937-eb6b539a-c8f9-4c18-acc3-2ae774ccb9d6.png)

Boom. 

Its worth noting that using any digit other than '0' will (stating the obvious a bit here) cause the value to wrap around and become `0xffffffffffffffff`. But leading
with '0's ensures that the value written is not changed (I got confused with this for a while lol).

# Exploitation

Now that we have an RIP overwrite with a value we completely control AND a libc leak, the next logical step was finding an applicable `one_gadget` we can use. Running
`one_gadget` on our libc provides 3 results. The one that works is:

```
0x448a3 execve("/bin/sh", rsp+0x30, environ)
constraints:
  [rsp+0x30] == NULL
```

Now with out of the way, things should be pretty EZ. Exploit is in the folder.
HTP.
